"Very dear team,"

"On Gradestraße, between the heights of Hornbach and Gottlieb-Dunkel-Straße in the direction of Schöneberg, there is currently a great deal of rubbish and rubbish right into the cycle path. I've been cycling this route for over 10 years and I've noticed that the garbage keeps increasing. Most of the time there was a lot of rubbish around the glass containers, but now there is a pile of rubbish under every tree. My heart is bleeding. But I can't think of any way to counteract this problem. (maybe wildlife cams?)"

"For at least five weeks, bulky waste and other rubbish has been piling up again on the cycle path and footpath on Gradestraße from around house number 60 to almost the allotment garden in front of the Gradestraße bridge, especially in the area of the glass containers. Some of the cycle path is now no longer passable. I would like to ask you to remedy this. Why do complaints and information from citizens always have to be made first? The public order office drives vehicles along this route regularly and the topic of the garbage that is disposed of there particularly often should be well known. This is annoying. Maybe video cameras should be installed there to catch the illegal disposal companies. I can bet that if the rubbish was in the lanes of the cars, it would be gone in no time. I am curious to see how long it will take to remove the rubbish from the bike/footpath this time."

Best regards

"I would like to report a large amount of dirt/bulky waste in Berlin Neukölln. I think it's a pity and sad that our neighborhood is getting so dirty with this campaign. I also find it very annoying. The 'Harzer Ecke' was introduced a year ago and since then it has unfortunately only been used to drop off private bulky waste. It's constantly dirty, messy and very disgusting to look at."
