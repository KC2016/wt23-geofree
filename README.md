## My work process

I found a tutorial on setting up a map component with React and Hooks. You can find the code here: https://github.com/trulymittal/google-maps-directions-tutorial

I used it and started deleting elements that I didn’t need (search bar, styling etc.). Once I had the working, minimal page, I refactored it, so that it’s based on a class component. I used another reference to help me: https://react-google-maps-api-docs.netlify.app/

I managed to center the zoom of the map on the location of the user and I hid the unneccessary labels.
