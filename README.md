### FIRST COMMIT

FYI about my work process.

I found a tutorial on setting up a map component with React and Hooks. You can find the code here: https://github.com/trulymittal/google-maps-directions-tutorial

I used it and started deleting elements that I didn’t need (search bar, styling etc.). Once I had the working, minimal page, I refactored it, so that it’s based on a class component. I used another reference for help: https://react-google-maps-api-docs.netlify.app/

I couldn’t figure out a way to safely store my API key from Google Maps so I left it visible in the Map component- I know it’s bad practice though.

Achtung! The app works in Chrome but not in Firefox :(
